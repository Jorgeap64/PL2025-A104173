Mark was sitting in his living room on a quiet evening in 2024-12-15, =reading a book while his cat slept beside him. The lamp was on, casting a warm glow over the pages. Suddenly, he heard a noise from the kitchen and went to check it. On his way back, he noticed the radio was still on, playing an old tune from the 1980s.
He sighed and turned it off before settling back in his chair. At that moment, his phone screen lit up with a notification: "Reminder: Meeting at 2025-01-05 09:00 AM." He made a mental note and placed the phone back on the table.
Later that night, just before heading to bed, Mark checked the thermostat. The heating was still on, and he debated whether to turn it off. It was a cold winter night, and he decided to leave it on at a lower setting. As he walked to his bedroom, he remembered to switch off the living room light, pressing the button = near the door.
The house fell silent, except for the faint hum of the refrigerator. Everything else was finally off, and Mark drifted into sleep, ready for the next day.
